Key Functions and Their Purpose
getRandomPosition:

Generates random x and y coordinates within the screen boundaries.
Ensures new blocks don't appear off-screen.
addBlock:

Adds a new block to the blocks state.
The new block has a random position and a parentId linking it to its parent.
onDragStart:

Triggered when the user starts dragging a block.
Saves the blockId of the dragged block in the drag event's dataTransfer.
onDragOver:

Allows the block to be dropped by preventing the default behavior.
Without this, the browser's default drag-and-drop behavior would interfere.
onDrop:

Updates the position of the dragged block based on where it was dropped.
Uses e.clientX and e.clientY to determine the mouse position.
SVG <line> Rendering:

Draws dashed lines between parent and child blocks.
The x1, y1 (parent center) and x2, y2 (child center) attributes define the line endpoints.
Dynamic Block Rendering:

Each block is rendered at its position with a draggable interface.
Clicking the + button inside a block creates a child block.
